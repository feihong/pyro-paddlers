# Catering from Chef Ping

Chef Ping is a Korean-style Chinese restaurant in Rolling Meadows. It also happens to be my favorite Chinese restaurant in Chicagoland. Here's what I ordered on race day:

- 胖胖鸡 Pong Pong Chicken
- 葱爆牛 Mongolian Beef
- 辣椒面 Ping's Noodle Platter
- 素什锦 Vegetarian's Delight
- 鲍菇玉豆腐 Mushroom Tofu
- 扬州炒饭 Yang Chow Fried Rice
- 两张皮 Summer Salad

We also got two trays of white race that came with our order.

You can call them at (847) 981-8888, or you could try [placing your order online](http://chefping.carry-out.com/). Below are my personal recommendations if you ever decide to eat at the restaurant.

### Appetizers

素鸡 Vegetarian Chicken - This is probably their best tofu dish

### Vegetables

炒豆苗 Sauteed Peapod Tips - Maybe not that special, but I think most suburban Chinese restaurants don't serve this

### 家乡菜 Old Time Favorite from Home

川北凉粉 Cold Thick Bean Noodle - You should ask the server what the difference is between this dish and 两张皮 Summer Salad, then order based on your personal preferences

### Noodle

炸酱面 Noodles in Black Bean Sauce - This is probably the Korean version of this dish

三鲜炸酱面 Seafood Peking Noodle - This is the seafood version of the above noodle dish

炒马面 Seafood Noodle Soup - Always get the spicy version of this noodle soup. Despite the description, it is actually not very spicy. The flavor is a bit subtle, so people who don't like bland food might not appreciate this.

辣椒面 Ping's Noodle Platter - Their signature dish, and also not that spicy despite the name. This is pretty good, but it's better the day after. If you can, order it to go and heat it up the next day for lunch!
