# Practice Guide

## What to Wear/Bring

- Water
- Suncreen
- Sunglasses
- Hat
- Light colored clothing that you don't mind getting wet (recommended: swim trunks or river shorts)
- Sandals or other footwear that dries quickly

They will have water on the dock for sale in case you forget to bring some.

## Checklist

- If this is your first time attending practice, fill out the [waiver form](/waiver-2018.pdf) (recommended: print and complete at home, bring to practice to save time)
- Warmup
- Put on life jacket (they are pretty much all the same size)
- Choose paddle (pick one whose handle comes up to your armpit)
- Hear explanation of paddling technique
- Board boat (we launch 30 minutes after start)
- Do drills on the water
- Eat hearty lunch at Whole Foods (optional)

## Things to Keep in Mind

- You can keep your bag and other belongings in the storage room by the dock while you're in the boat
- There are no changing rooms
- There are no restrooms at the boathouse. You can use the restrooms at Whole Foods (turn left at the entrance) or Starbucks (across the street).

## Extra Practices/Practice Makeup

Can't attend one or both of the UIC open practices? You can sign up for a [non-team open practice](https://www.meetup.com/Greater-Chicago-Dragon-Boat-Club/events/) at the same practice site through Meetup.com. Their open practice is usually on Sundays at 10:30 am, the training should be roughly the same, and you can attend 2 of these practices for free. Attending a non-team open practice also qualifies you to be considered for the race roster; simply inform the team captain after the practice.
