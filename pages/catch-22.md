This restaurant is very close to the race site, and coincidentally it is also my favorite restaurant in the Chicagoland area! (Yes, I have been to Chicago's Chinatown. Many times.) Overall this is a really solid Chinese restaurant, so you can't go too wrong with whatever the server recommends. Below are some highlights from their menu. Inveterate foodies can read this [very long forum post about the restaurant](http://www.lthforum.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=27220).

You can view their [full menu online](https://web.archive.org/web/20171212082847/http://www.chefping.com:80/menu.html). Note that this is a Wayback Machine link; their site is currently offline. A solid backup option would be [Penang](https://goo.gl/maps/6nYeMBeetnE2), a well-regarded Malaysian restaurant that is roughly the same distance from the race site.

### Appetizers

素鸡 Vegetarian Chicken - This is probably their best tofu dish

### 家乡菜 Old Time Favorite from Home

川北凉粉 Cold Thick Bean Noodle - You should ask the server what the difference is between this dish and 两张皮 Summer Salad, then order based on your personal preferences

### Noodle

炸酱面 Noodles in Black Bean Sauce - This is probably the Korean version of this dish

三鲜炸酱面 Seafood Peking Noodle - This is the seafood version of the above noodle dish

炒马面 Seafood Noodle Soup - Always get the spicy version of this noodle soup. Despite the description, it is actually not very spicy. The flavor is a bit subtle, so people who don't like bland food might not appreciate this.

辣椒面 Ping's Noodle Platter - Their signature dish, and also not that spicy despite the name. This is pretty good, but it's better the day after. If you can, order it to go and heat it up the next day for breakfast or lunch!

## Exploring the City

You can try to book an hour with [Greater Chicago Dragon Boat Club](http://www.greaterchicagodragonboatclub.org/), which would allow you to paddle into the heart of downtown Chicago inside a dragon boat!
